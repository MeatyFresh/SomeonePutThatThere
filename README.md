## Howdy

Here I appreciate some of the little details added to video games, hiding in dark and dusty corners or in areas of the map that exist but you don't need to go to. They're not (_always_) easter eggs, neither are they secrets or purposeful, but they exist, and someone, somewhere, has gone to the effort to include it. We can bring these little details to light, these tiny added extras which most miss and the rest don't think about when they happen to catch sight of them. When you see a little detail hidden away in a secluded area you've accidentally found yourself in, take a moment to think. _Someone put that there_.
